  <p>Alice was very surprised. "This is getting weirder and weirder!" she said. She was so surprised that she forgot to speak good English. "Now I’m growing like the biggest telescope! Goodbye, feet!" When Alice looked down, her feet were so far away that she could hardly see them. "Oh, my poor little feet! Who will put shoes on you now? I can’t reach you anymore. You’ll have to take care of yourselves. But I must be kind to them," she thought, "or maybe they won’t walk where I want to go. I know! I’ll give them new shoes every Christmas." She started thinking about how she would send them shoes.</p>
  <p>  Then, Alice’s head hit the ceiling. She was now more than nine feet tall! She quickly picked up the little golden key and hurried to the garden door. But poor Alice! She could only look into the garden with one eye. It was impossible to get through the door now. She sat down and began to cry again.</p>
<p>  "You should be ashamed," Alice told herself. "You’re a big girl, and you’re crying like a baby! Stop crying right now!" But she couldn’t stop, and soon there was a big pool of tears around her. The water was four inches deep and filled half of the hall.</p>
  <p>  After a while, Alice heard little footsteps in the distance. She quickly dried her eyes to see who it was. It was the White Rabbit, coming back. He was dressed very nicely, holding a pair of white gloves in one hand and a big fan in the other. He was talking to himself, "Oh no, the Duchess! She will be so angry if I’m late!"</p>  
<p>  Alice was so desperate that she decided to ask the Rabbit for help. When he came near, she said in a small, shy voice, "Excuse me, sir—" The Rabbit jumped, dropped the gloves and fan, and ran away as fast as he could.</p>
